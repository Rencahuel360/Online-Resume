    <!-- Summary -->
    <h2>My summary</h2>
    <p>I am currently a student<b> who is learning web development again</b> , also very motivated on anything related
        to
        computers and programming.
        In three months I'll be 17 year old, which gives me one year to decide what am I going to do for the rest of my
        life
    </p>

    <!-- Education-->
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Currently I'm attending high school... yep... that's all the 'studies' that I have, a public school (I've learnt
        absolutely nothing ). After that I want to go to university. I'm
        learning English on my own <b>(this web is written with my poor knowledge and Google Translator.. so sorry if
            something isn't grammarly correct)</b>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <!-- Work Experience-->
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>Zero, I have never worked on something important or related with what I am learning right now. Maybe I'll be
        starving in a few years.</p>

    <!-- Skills and hobbies-->
    <h2>Skills (Hobbies)</h2>
    <p>Now that I have trust with you, reader, I'm going to admit that I have a lot of hobbies, but I am uncapable of
        finish something. Maybe
        there's something wrong with me... I don't know, actually, years ago I was also learning web development, the
        same courses but... this always happens.
        Anyways, this section should be called hobbies instead. (I'll change it later).

    <!-- Future -->
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>I will be updating this piece of... when it needs to. I hope that his webpage grows as a plant, starting from the
        absolutely nothing
        to be a pretty flower (I don't know why did I said that metaphor) or this flower could wither, only the time
        knows.
